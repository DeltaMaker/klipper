# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of delta
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# delta printer. Only parameters unique to delta printers are
# described here - see the "example.cfg" and "example-extras.cfg" files
# for description of common config parameters.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with.  The default is "extruder".
heater_temp: 50.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must drop below before
#   the fan is disabled. The default is 50 Celsius.
#fan_speed:
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when its associated heater is enabled. The default
#   is max_power.

#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: 22.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.

activate_gcode:
    SET_PIN PIN=solenoid_pin VALUE=1
    G4 P100 
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute prior to each
#   probe attempt. This may be useful if the probe needs to be
#   activated in some way. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on activation.
deactivate_gcode:
    SET_PIN PIN=solenoid_pin VALUE=0
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute after each
#   probe attempt completes. The default is to not run any special

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#

[bed_mesh]
speed: 150
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 10
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#samples_result: average
#   One can choose median or average between probes samples
#   The default is average.
sample_retract_dist: 4.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
bed_radius: 100
#   Defines the radius to probe for round beds.  Note that the radius
#   is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a probe be sure to
#   account for its offset.  This parameter must be provided for round
#   beds and omitted for rectangular beds.
#min_point:
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Note that this refers to the nozzle position, take care that
#   you do not define a point that will move the probe off of the bed.
#   This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#max_point:
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point. Also note
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this is integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.



# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the front
# left tower (at 210 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all towers.

position_endstop: 473.4
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstop triggers. This
#   parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for stepper_b and

#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not place any limit on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_lookahead_time: 0.010
#   A time (in seconds) to "look ahead" at future extrusion moves when
#   calculating pressure advance. This is used to reduce the
#   application of pressure advance during cornering moves that would
#   otherwise cause retraction followed immediately by pressure
#   buildup. This setting only applies if pressure_advance is
#   non-zero. The default is 0.010 (10 milliseconds).

[printer]
kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 300
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 1000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 100
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
delta_radius: 110.0
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.


# Idle timeout. An idle timeout is automatically enabled - add an
# explicit idle_timeout config section to change the default settings.
#[idle_timeout]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute on an idle timeout. The default is to run

#timeout: 600
#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.


# 10/7/2018
# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the tower endstop positions and
# angles.
[delta_calibrate]
radius: 100
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is the radius
#   of nozzle coordinates to be probed; if using an automatic probe
#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 2
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if sampling
#   more than once. The default is 2mm.
